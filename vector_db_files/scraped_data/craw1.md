The 55 Greatest Soccer Players of All Time ON SISI SWIMSUITSI TICKETSSI RESORTSSI SHOPSMY ACCOUNTSUBSCRIBE NOWMARCH MADNESSNFLNBAWNBANCAABNCAAFMLBSOCCERGOLFMEDIABETTINGFANTASYThe 55 Greatest Soccer Players of All TimeLionel Messi, Pele, Cristiano Ronaldo and Diego Maradona headline the greatest soccer players of all time. SI Staff, Barnaby Lane | Mar 14, 2025Lionel Messi led Argentina to the 2022 World Cup title / Maria Lysaker-Imagn ImagesRanking the 55 greatest soccer players of all time is no easy feat—and one that's bound to ignite heated debates. Zidane, Ronaldo, the other Ronaldo, Messi, Maradona: How does one even begin to compare legends from different generations?But there's a method to the madness. This carefully curated list doesn't just rank the best players in history; it focuses on the highest peaks each of these icons reached during their careers.From jaw-dropping individual performances to game-changing moments on the grandest stages, this list celebrates those who, at their very best, defined eras and redefined the sport.So, without further ado, here’s the definitive ranking of the 55 greatest players in soccer history.55. Manuel NeuerManuel Neuer. / Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn ImagesPeak: 2014-2020Major Achievements: 2014 FIFA World Cup, 11 Bundesliga titles, two UEFA Champions Leagues, five-time IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper.Manuel Neuer redefined the role of the modern goalkeeper. A true "sweeper-keeper," the German legend became famous for venturing out of his box to command the defense and play with his feet.While he wasn’t the first to adopt this style, Neuer’s unmatched athleticism, cat-like reflexes, and world-class shot-stopping abilities elevated the position to new heights, setting the blueprint for future greats like Ederson to follow.54. Wayne RooneyPeak: 2006-2010Major Achievements: Four Premier League titles, one Champions League, one FA Cup, three League Cups, Manchester United record goalscorer. Peak Wayne Rooney was a force to be reckoned with.A lethal combination of power, pace, skill, aggression, and sheer brutality, there were few, if any, Premier League defenses that could stop the English striker.Though in his later years, he lost some of the pace and fiery edge that made him such a fierce and unique character, Rooney still finished his career at Manchester United with 253 goals in all competitions—a figure that makes him the club's record goalscorer.53. Gheorghe HagiPeak: 1994-2000Major Achievements: Three SuperLiga titles, two Supercopa de España titles, four Süper Lig titles, UEFA Cup.Known for his magical left foot, Gheorghe Hagi lit up the pitch while playing for two of Europe's biggest clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona.However, the Romanian legend's most remarkable achievements came on the international stage and with Turkish giants Galatasaray.At the 1994 World Cup, Hagi was the driving force behind Romania's surprise run to the quarterfinals, scoring three goals and earning a spot in the Team of the Tournament. Six years later, he pulled off another historic feat, leading Galatasaray to UEFA Cup glory by defeating Arsenal in the final—though his triumph was slightly overshadowed by a late red card.52. Kenny DalglishPeak: 1978-1984Major Achievements: Four Scottish Division One titles, six English First Division titles, three European Cups.You have to be some player to be widely considered the greatest of all time for two separate clubs— but that's exactly what Kenny Dalglish was: some player.A soccer genius with an exceptional footballing brain, the Scotsman first shone as the crown jewel in a Celtic side that ruled Scottish football during the 1970s.After his transfer to Liverpool in 1977 for just over half a million dollars, Dalglish then repeated the feat with the Reds, becoming the star of a team that dominated European soccer for the next decade, clinching six league titles and three European Cups.51. Neymar Jr.Neymar. / IMAGO/XinhuaPeak: 2013-2017Major Achievements: Two La Liga titles, one UEFA Champions League, five Ligue 1 titles, Brazil's record goalscorer.For a man of his almost ethereal talents, Neymar’s career feels like a story of unfulfilled potential. While he collected trophies with Paris Saint-Germain, the decision to leave FC Barcelona for a weaker league—when he seemingly had the world at his feet—remains puzzling. The answer, of course, is money.Despite becoming Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer, he also never managed to guide the Seleção to a major international title.That said, during his peak years alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez at Barca, Neymar was simply unstoppable. Unbelievably skillful, audacious, and with a touch of arrogance, he arguably eclipsed Cristiano Ronaldo as the second-best player in the world during that period.50. Kylian MbappePeak: 2018-presentMajor Achievements: 2018 FIFA World Cup, seven Ligue 1 titles, 2022 FIFA World Cup Golden Boot, four French Cups, five French Super Cups.Back in February 2016, 17-year-old Kylian Mbappé scored his first goal for Ligue 1 side As Monaco before going on to knockout Manchester Cty and Pep Guardiola in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16.During his time at PSG when he racked up well over 200 goals, Mbappé continued to impress on the international stage with France. He made a name for himself by leading France to glory in the 2018 World Cup at just 19-years-old. Although France came up short in the 2022 World Cup final, Mbappé's hat trick in the final gave them a chance at going back-to-back as he claimed the Golden Boot in Qatar.Mbappé has already enjoyed a career that most players would dream of having. Now, he continues to push on in his prime at Real Madrid in a bid to lift his first UEFA Champions League trophy. 49. Luka ModricModric is a Real Madrid legend / Daniel Bartel-Imagn ImagesPeak: 2014-18Major Achievements: 2018 Ballon d'Or, 2018 UEFA Men's Best Player of the Year, 2018 the Best FIFA Men's Player, FIFA World Cup Golden Ball 2018, six UEFA Champions Leagues.We start off with a man who did the impossible in 2018: in the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo-era, he won the Ballon d'Or. Luka Modric's ending of the decade of dominance of football's greatest individual was more than deserved. At the very peak of his powers, Modric led an unfancied Croatian outfit to the 2018 FIFA World Cup final and won approximately a billion UEFA Champions League titles with Real Madrid. 48. Hugo SanchezPeak: 1986-90Major Achievements: 1990 European Golden Shoe, five-time Pichichi winner, five La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey. Hugo Sanchez is one of the greatest goalscorers in La Liga history. Hugo Sanchez scored an obscene amount of goals during his peak. 157 in four seasons to be exact. The Mexico international was one of the most natural finishers of his generation, and deservedly makes this list of the greatest footballers of all time. 47. JairzinhoPeak: 1970Major Achievements: 1970 World Cup, only player to score in every game of a World CupYou read that major achievement right. Jairzinho is the only player in FIFA World Cup history to score in every single game of the tournament. He did so while guiding the greatest football team of all time to a FIFA World Cup triumph. 46. Omar SivoriPeak: 1958-61Major Achievements: 1961 Ballon d'Or, 1959/60 Capocannoniere, three Scudetti, two Coppa Italia titles. Before there was a Lionel Messi. Before there was a Diego Maradona. There was an Omar Sivori. An Argentine-Italian forward who led Juventus during their formative years as a European powerhouse under the stewardship of the great Umberto Agnelli. With Sivori in the famous number 10 jersey, La Vecchia Signora won three Scudetti and two Coppa Italia titles. 45. Paolo Rossi Peak: 1982Major Achievements: 1982 Ballon d'Or, 1982 World Cup, FIFA World Cup Golden Ball 2018, 1977/78 Capocannoniere, two Scudetti, one Coppa Italia title, one European Cup. Paolo Rossi's one year peak was so astounding that he has more than earned his place among the 50 greatest footballers of all time. Rossi emerged from the depths of a lengthy ban after Totonero, to become the iconic figure of Gli Azzurri's 1982 World Cup triumph. A hat-trick against a seemingly unbeatable Brazil team, two against a good Poland team, and a goal in the final against an exceptional West Germany team; it's fair to say that Rossi had a good tournament...a really, really, really good tournament. 44. Paul Breitner Peak: 1974-81Major Achievements: 1981 Ballon d'Or runner-up, 1974 World Cup, 1972 UEFA European Championships, FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, five Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokal titles, one European Cup.Paul Breitner could do it all. Name something, and he could probably do it. 'Score in a World Cup final?'Yeah. Easy work. 'Man mark the best wingers in the world?'Yeah, of course.43. George WeahPeak: 1993-96Major Achievements: 1995 Ballon d'Or, three-time African Footballer of the Year, two Scudetti, one Ligue 1 title, two Coupe de France, one FA Cup. Ok, so in most other 'Greatest Footballers of All Time' lists, George Weah probably wouldn't make the cut, because there was a period of time in which he was at Chelsea and Manchester City and was, well, pretty terrible. However, with this being a list of the GOATs at their peaks, Weah makes the cut. At his best, Weah was unstoppable. A rare combination of physical prowess and unbelievable technical ability, the former Liberian president was the most complete forward of the 1990s. 42. KakaPeak: 2005-09Major Achievements: 2007 Ballon d'Or, 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year, two-time Serie A Footballer of the Year, two-time Time 100 list member, 2002 FIFA World Cup, one Scudetti, one UEFA Champions League, one La Liga, one Copa del Rey. At his best, Kaka was unstoppable. A rare combination of physical prowess and unbelievable technical ability, the former Brazil international was the most complete attacking midfielders of the 2000s.41. Lev Yashin Peak: 1956-64Major Achievements: 1963 Ballon d'Or, Olympic gold medal, 1960 UEFA European Football Championship, FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, five Soviet Top League titles, Order of Lenin. Lev Yashin is one of the most important footballers of all time. A leader, an innovator, the greatest testament to Yashin's talent is the fact that he is the only goalkeeper to ever win the Ballon d'Or. Ever.Impressive. 40. Gunnar Nordahl Peak: 1950-55Major Achievements: Olympic gold medal, five-time Capocannoniere, two Scudetti. There's one thing that defines Gunnar Nordahl's career: goals.Gunnar Nordahl scored goals. A lot of them. The Swedish forward scored so many goals between 1950 and 1955 that he won the Capocannoniere in four of these seasons, and became AC Milan's all-time record goalscorer.He also held the record for most goals scored in a single Serie A season for 66 years...until a certain Gonzalo Higuain came along. 39. Kevin KeeganPeak: 1977-79Major Achievements: 1978 & 1979 Ballon d'Or, 1981/82 PFA Players' Player of the Year, three Football League First Division titles, one FA Cup, one European Cup, two UEFA Cup titles, one Bundesliga. "I tell ya, honestly, I'd love it if we beat them! Love it!" When you read Kevin Keegan's name that interview is what came to mind isn't it? But if you can, just for a moment, put aside the aforementioned rage induced rant and the subsequent bottling of the Premier League title race, you'll see just how incredible a footballer Keegan really was. In fact, Kevin Keegan was one of the greatest English footballers of all time. He won the Ballon d'Or twice. Twice. Keegan also became English soccer's undisputed greatest ever export during his time a Hamburger SV; where he was lauded as a 'savior' for winning the Bundesliga title in 1979.38. Hristo Stoichkov Peak: 1990-94Major Achievements: 1994 Ballon d'Or, 1990 European Golden Shoe, five-time Bulgarian Footballer of the Year, one UEFA Champions League, five La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey.Scoring six goals in the the 1994 FIFA World Cup, including one in each of the knockout rounds, Stoichkov came within touching distance of taking an eternally unfancied Bulgarian outfit to the final; earning himself the Ballon d'Or in the process. On top of this incredible international achievement, Stoichkov, particularly between 1990 and 1994, enjoyed a pretty impressive club career too. Teaming up with Romario at Barcelona in his prime, Stoichkov became one of the most feared forwards in Europe, and helped the 'Dream Team' to a UEFA Champions League triumph in 1992.37. Gianluigi Buffon Peak: 2002-06Major Achievements: 2006 Ballon d'Or runner-up, 2006 FIFA World Cup, 12-time Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year, 2002/03 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, two-time Pallone Azzurro, 2016/17 Serie A Footballer of the Year, 11 Scudetti, five Coppa Italia titles, one UEFA Cup.The greatest goalkeeper of all time? Yeah, probably.Put simply, no goalkeeper has ever been better for longer than Gianluigi Buffon. And no one ever will. At his best, he would only concede two goals (one a freak Cristian Zaccardo own goal, the other a Zinedine Zidane penalty) on route to a World Cup triumph, at his worst he was one of the top three goalkeepers in Europe. There will never be another Gianluigi Buffon.36. Johan Neeskens Peak: 1971-78Major Achievements: 1974 & 1978 FIFA World Cup runner-up, 1974 FIFA World Cup Silver Boot, three European Cups, two Eredivisie, two KNVB Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, one Copa del Rey.The 'two guard' for the great Netherlands, Ajax and Barcelona teams of the 1970s, Johan Neeskens may have always been in the shadow of Johan Cruyff, but his talent cannot be underestimated. Neeskens was the brutally hard working ying to Cruyff's beautifully artistic yang, and it's more than fair to say that without one Johan, there couldn't have been the other. 35. Xavi HernandezMajor Achievements: 2010 FIFA World Cup, 2008 & 2012 UEFA European Championship, 2008 UEFA European Championship Player of the Tournament, 2005 La Liga Spanish Player of the Year, four UEFA Champions Leagues, eight La Liga titles, three Copa del Rey. The fulcrum of two of the greatest football teams of all time. A winner of literally every single trophy that has ever existed. A player that 'changed football'.34. Luis SuarezPeak: 1960-65Major Achievements: 1960 Ballon d'Or, two European Cups, two Intercontinental Cups, three Scudetti, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey. This isn't the Uruguayan Luis Suarez who tore up La Liga with Lionel Messi and Barcelona, the Premier League with Liverpool, or... MLS with Lionel Messi again.This is the Spanish Luis Suarez who, during the first half of the 1960s, dominated European football with a revolutionary Inter side. In this fruitful period Suarez won the Ballon d'Or, three Scudetti and two consecutive European Cups. 33. Karl-Heinz RummeniggePeak: 1979-84Major Achievements: 1980 & 1981 Ballon d'Or, 1980 German Footballer of the Year, three-time Torjägerkanone, 1980 UEFA European Championship, two European Cups, two Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokal. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge may better known as one of the members of the Bayern Munich board to younger readers of this article; to the older readers however, the German is remembered for being one of the most fearsome forwards of the 1980s. Always the bridesmaid and never the bride at the World Cup, he was a beaten finalist on two occasions but a winner in literally every other competition he ever played in. 32. Andres Iniesta Peak: 2008-12Major Achievements: 2010 FIFA World Cup, 2008 & 2012 UEFA European Championships, four UEFA Champions Leagues, nine La Liga titles, six Copa del Rey, 2012 UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award. Is Andres Iniesta the most likeable footballer on this list? Yes, yes he is. Is he also the most successful footballer on this list? Well, he's certainly right up there. He did with style too, as one of the most skillful footballers of his generation in fact. 31. Rivelino Peak: 1968-74Major Achievements: 1970 FIFA World Cup, 1970 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team, two Campeonato Carioca titles. If you take the time to watch some YouTube highlights of Rivelino or find some full game tapes from the 1970 FIFA World Cup, you'll understand just what 'Joga Bonito' really is. It's the beautiful game; something that no one has ever personified quite like Rivelino did. 30. Bobby MoorePeak: 1964-70Major Achievements: 1966 FIFA World Cup, 1970 Ballon d'Or runner-up, 1964 FA Cup, PFA Player of the Century, FIFA World Cup All-Time Team.Winning the World Cup is an incredible achievement, and it's one that would not have been possible without one of the greatest defenders and leaders of all time: Bobby Moore.A class act both on and off the pitch, Moore has been rightfully immortalized in statue form outside of Wembley Stadium.29. SocratesPeak: 1976-84Major Achievements: Three Campeonato Paulista, 1983 South American Footballer of the Year, 1980 Bola de Prata, 1976 Campeonato Paulista top scorer.A man as important off the field the as he was on it, he democratized Corinthians, creating a voting system for the club's decision making process. The 'Doctor' is one of the most significant figures in Brazilian football history.A rare mix of elegance and power, Socrates was the perfect all-round midfielder.28. Sandor KocsisPeak: 1950-55Major Achievements: Olympic gold medal, 1954 FIFA World Cup Golden Boot, 1954 FIFA World Cup runner-up, 75 goals in 68 caps for Hungary, two La Liga titles, four Hungarian titles.Sandor Kocsis scored 75 goals in 68 international appearances for Hungary. In 1954, Sandor Kocsis scored 23 goals in 14 international appearances for Hungary. At the 1954 FIFA World Cup, Sandor Kocsis scored 11 goals in five games. All of the aforementioned facts exemplify one simple thing: Sandor Kocsis scored goals. A shocking amount of goals. 27. Lothar MatthausPeak: 1988-92Major Achievements: 1990 Ballon d'Or, 1991 FIFA World Player of the Year, 1990 FIFA World Cup, 1980 UEFA European Football Championship, two UEFA Cups, seven Bundesliga titles, one Scudetto, three DFB-Pokal titles. Put simply, Matthaus was the most complete player of his generation, a generation that just so happened to spawn the likes of Michel Platini, Diego Maradona, Zico etc.A natural born winner, and a natural born world shaker (his goal against Yugoslavia at the 1990 FIFA World Cup definitely registered on the Richter scale), Matthaus could, and did, do it all. 26. Ronaldinho Major Achievements: 2005 Ballon d'Or, 2004 & 2005 FIFA World Player of the Year, 2005/06 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, 2004 & 2005 FIFPro World Player of the Year, one UEFA Champions League, two La Liga titles, one Scudetto. "The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long," is a quote that perfectly encapsulates Ronaldinho's career.Between 2004 and 2006, the world bore witness to something truly special: a footballer who played the beautiful game with genuine joy.The flicks, the tricks, the gold boots, the smile, Ronaldinho was a walking advertisement for everything good about soccer. 25. Ruud GullitPeak: 1986-90Major Achievements: 1987 Ballon d'Or, two-time Dutch Footballer of the Year, 1988 UEFA European Championship, two European Cups, three Scudetti, three Eredivisie titles, one Coppa Italia, one KNVB Cup.In the late 80s, Gullit was the unstoppable force that led an unstoppable AC Milan juggernaut that dominated European soccer.Deservedly winning soccer's equivalent of the MVP award (1987 Ballon d'Or), the Dutch international was soccer's equivalent to a triple-double machine. 24. Bobby CharltonPeak: 1963-67Major Achievements: 1966 Ballon d'Or, 1966 FIFA World Cup, 1966 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 1967/68 European Cup, three Football League First Division titles, 1962/63 FA Cup. Remember how good Frank Lampard was?Bobby Charlton was like Frank Lampard, only 100x better.The best player in the best England team of all time, Charlton was really, really, really good.23. Giuseppe Meazza Peak: 1934-38Major Achievements: 1934 & 1938 FIFA World Cup, 1934 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, three Scudetti, one Coppa Italia, three Capocannoniere.So good they named the most famous stadium in the world after him, Giuseppe Meazza is the first legend of Italian soccer.A mythical figure on the peninsula, those who know say Meazza is the greatest Italian footballer of all time; those who don't say he's the 23rd best player of all time. 22. Raymond KopaPeak: 1956-59Major Achievements: 1958 Ballon d'Or, 1961 French Player of the Year, 1958 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team, three European Cups, two La Liga titles, four Ligue 1 titles.Raymond Kopa is one of three geniuses of French soccer.A proverbial name in the top three of Ballon d'Or voting throughout his peak years, Kopa was the creative force that enabled Ferenc Puskas and Alfredo Di Stefano to score a boatload of goals for Real Madrid in the 1950s and 60s. He also helped guide Real Madrid to three European Cup triumphs.So yeah, by all accounts, a good player. 21. Romario Peak: 1990-94Major Achievements: 1994 FIFA World Player of the Year, 1994 FIFA World Cup, 1994 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 1994 World Cup All-Star Team, 1989 & 1997 Copa America, one La Liga, three time Eredivisie, 1993/94 Pichichi winner.The 'King of the Lob' was one of the most composed and clinical goalscorers of the 1990s, who was also - most importantly - a big game player.A 1994 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball award here, a Clasico hat trick there, Romario was a man for the big occasion. 20. Eusebio Peak: 1962-68Major Achievements: 1965 Ballon d'Or, 1966 European Golden Boot, 1968 & 1973 European Golden Boot, 1962 European Cup, 11 Primeira Liga titles, five Taca de Portugal titles. Like Romario, Eusebio was a supreme goalscorer. Unlike Romario, Eusebio didn't exclaim that he scored over 1,000 career goals; but he came pretty close to doing so.19. Marco van Basten Peak: 1988-92Major Achievements: 1988, 1989 & 1992 Ballon d'Or, 1992 FIFA World Player of the Year, 1989, 1990 & 1992 UEFA Best Player of the Year, 1984/85 Dutch Footballer of the Year, two Capocannoniere, 1988 UEFA European Championship, two European Cups, three Scudetti, three Eredivisie, three KNVB Cups. It's a testament to Marco van Basten that he won three Ballon d'Ors, and is (due to injuries) still considered to be a 'what could've been' story. That's how good Marco van Basten was.Both technically sublime and extremely powerful in equal measure, Van Basten was the perfect number nine.He could, and did, score every sort of goal you can imagine.18. George BestPeak: 1966-71Major Achievements: 1968 Ballon d'Or, 1967/68 FWA Footballer of the Year, 1967/68 Football League First Division top scorer, 1968 European Cup, two Football League First Division titles.Affectionately known as the 'fifth Beatle', George Best is perhaps remembered more for his off-the-field antics as opposed to his on-the-pitch achievements. However, that's not to say he wasn't an extraordinary talent.Because he 100% was. In fact, he's the most naturally gifted player the British and Irish Isles have ever produced.A Ballon d'Or and European Cup winner, Best peaked early in his career, but what a peak it was.17. Zico Peak: 1979-82Major Achievements: Five-time Bola de Prata winner, three-time South American Footballer of the Year, top scorer in Flamengo's history, 1981 Copa Libertadores Best Player, 1981 Copa Libertadores, 1981 Intercontinental Cup, three Campeonato Brasilerio Serie A titles. Zico latches on the ball near the halfway line, and loops a seemingly aimless pass into the left hand side of the penalty area. To normal humans, such a pass looked aimless, but Zico saw an opportunity. Moments later Flamengo were 1-0 up against the greatest Liverpool team of all time.30 minutes later, Flamengo were three goals to the good courtesy of another two Zico assists.An hour later, they were world champions.That's who Zico was. A genius who saw the game in a different way. A genius who could conjure something from absolutely nothing. A genius that made everyone around him better.Flamengo's greatest ever goalscorer.Flamengo's greatest ever playmaker.Flamengo's greatest ever player. 16. Franco Baresi Major Achievements: AC Milan Player of the Century, Serie A Player of the Century, 1982 FIFA World Cup, six Scudetti, three European Cups, two Intercontinental Cups, 1989 Ballon d'Or runner-up.Unlike a lot of the players on this list, the 'peak' criteria means that we've had to drop Baresi down a few places. After all, what stands out about the Italian is his incredible consistency throughout his 20 year career.Nevertheless, Baresi still makes it into the top 20 players of all time, because if you look at the years in which the defender was at the 'peak' of his powers he was impossible to get past.15. Cristiano Ronaldo Ronaldo is one of the greatest goal scorers of all time / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesPeak: 2012-16Major Achievements: 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 & 2017 Ballon d'Or, 2008, 2016 & 2017 FIFA World Player of the Year, 2014, 2016 & 2017 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, four-time European Golden Shoe winner, two-time PFA Players' Player of the Year, UEFA Champions League all time top goalscorer, Real Madrid's all time top goalscorer, five UEFA Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, three Premier League titles, one Scudetto, two Copa del Rey, one FA Cup, one UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo is simply another player who, like Franco Baresi, is hurt by the criteria of this list. That by no means means we don't think he is a fantastic footballer. He is. The stats prove it. The goals prove it. The five Ballons d'Or prove it. CR7 is one of the best players of his generation. A player who has found the net with such consistency that a 40 goal season is actually somewhat disappointing.14. Ferenc PuskasPeak: 1950-54Major Achievements: European Player of the 20th Century, Olympic gold medal, 1954 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 1960 Ballon d'Or runner-up, 1954 FIFA World Cup runner-up, four-time Pichichi winner, four-time Hungarian league top scorer, two-time European Cup top scorer, three European Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, five La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey, five Hungarian League titles. In the early 1950s, he was at the peak of his physical powers, and leading the one of the most exceptional teams of all time.The star man was, in many ways, the perfect footballer. Strong, skillful, a goalscorer and, maybe most importantly a leader.Check out his goal against England in the 'Match of the Century'. After latching onto the ball on the edge of the six-yard box, the forward dragged the ball back, leaving Billy Wright for dead, before firing into the roof of the net. That goal is how good Puskas was: absolutely exceptional. 13. Paolo Maldini Peak: 1994-2003Major Achievements: Most Serie A appearances of all time, most AC Milan appearances of all time, five European Cups, seven Scudetti, one Coppa Italia, two Intercontinental Cup, 1994 FIFA World Cup runner-up, 2000 UEFA European Football Championship runner-up. If you were to make the perfect player in some sort of lab, you'd probably create Paolo Maldini.Maldini is most complete footballer of the past 30 years. At the very least, a 9/10 in every single position he could be played in, and a 10/10 week in, week out as a defender.When Nike ran the ad campaign:"Italy's Goalkeeper: Easiest Job in the World."They were right. Maldini made it the easiest job in the world. He made every single one of his teammates' jobs the easiest in the world. 12. Gerd MullerPeak: 1970-74Major Achievements: 1970 Ballon d'Or, 1974 FIFA World Cup, 1972 UEFA European Championship, 1970 FIFA World Cup Golden Boot, two-time German Footballer of the Year, two-time European Golden Shoe winner, seven-time Torjägerkanone, thee European Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, four Bundesliga titles, four DFB-Pokals. The sky is blue. Grass is green. And Gerd Muller is one of the best goalscorers of all time.68 goals in 62 international appearances for West Germany. The man once scored 67 goals in a single season, in just 49 appearances. He also scored a goal that won West Germany the 1974 FIFA World Cup. A goalscorer for the big moments, the small moments, and every moment in between. 11. Mane Garrincha Peak: 1958-62Major Achievements: 1958 & 1962 FIFA World Cup, 1962 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 1962 FIFA World Cup Golden Boot, three State Championships. Garrincha is the original Samba soccer star; someone who brought the game played in the streets of Brasilia, Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo to the international stage, and utilized it to win two FIFA World Cups. 10. Alfredo di Stefano Peak: 1956-62Major Achievements: 1957 & 1959 Ballon d'Or, five European Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, eight La Liga titles, five-time Pichichi winner, World Team of the 20th Century, one Copa del Rey.“People argue between Pele or Maradona. Di Stéfano is the best, much more complete.” (Pele)"Di Stéfano was one of the greatest footballers ever. He had such great balance.” (Alex Ferguson)"The most complete footballer in the history of the game.” (Eusebio)“He was simply the most intelligent football player I ever saw. If I had one player to choose, out of all of them, to save my life, he'd be the one.” (Bobby Charlton)After reading the aforementioned praise of Alfredo di Stefano, is there anything else to add?9. Roberto Baggio Peak: 1990-94Major Achievements: 1993 Ballon d'Or, 1993 FIFA World Player of the Year, Italy's Player of the Century, 1994 FIFA World Cup Silver Ball, 1994 FIFA World Cup runner-up, two Scudetti, one UEFA Cup, one Coppa Italia. Spoke of almost exclusively using biblical allusions, Roberto Baggio was a glimpse of God.A player divinely inspired to conjure the impossible on a pitch, and change Italian fans' perception of the beautiful game forever. 8. Michel PlatiniPeak: 1982-85Major Achievements: 1983, 1984, 1985 Ballon d'Or, French Player of the Century, two-time French Player of the Year, three-time Capocannoniere, 1984 UEFA European Championship Player of the Tournament, 1984 UEFA European Championship, one European Cup, two Scudetti, one Ligue 1 title, one Coppa Italia, one Intercontinental Cup.Remember when it was said earlier that Bobby Charlton was like Frank Lampard, only 100x better? Well, Platini was like Frank Lampard, only 200x better.Michel Platini is undoubtedly the greatest goalscoring midfielder of all time.In three consecutive seasons in his prime, Platini won the Golden Boot award in a league which boasted the best defenders of all time; scratch that, the best players of all time.Platini was similarly potent for France, guiding the nation to their first ever major football success by scoring nine goals in five games at the 1984 UEFA European Championships.7. RonaldoPeak: 1995-98Major Achievements: 1997 & 2002 Ballon d'Or, 1996, 1997 & 2002 FIFA World Player of the Year, 1998 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 2002 FIFA World Cup Golden Shoe, 1996/97 European Golden Shoe, 1994 & 2002 FIFA World Cup, 1997 & 1999 Copa America, two-time Pichichi winner, 1998 Serie A Footballer of the Year, two La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey, one KNVB Cup, one UEFA Cup, one Intercontinental Cup.Are Ronaldo's knee injuries the only things that stopped the Brazilian from being the number one, undisputed, greatest footballer of all time? Quite possibly.Pre-knee injury, R9 was well on his way to becoming the best to ever lace up a pair of boots.In short, he was the perfect forward.The perfect exemplification of R9's mastery is his goal against Compostela. Sir Bobby Robson's reaction says it all.6. Zinedine ZidanePeak: 1997-2002Major Achievements: 1998 Ballon d'Or, 1998, 2000 & 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year, 2002 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, 2000/01 Serie A Footballer of the Year, UEFA Champions League Best Player of the Past 20 Years, L'Equipe Best French Player of All Time, 2006 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, only player to be named Player of the Year in three of the top five leagues, most goals in FIFA World Cup finals, 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2000 UEFA European Championships, one Champions League, two Scudetti, one La Liga title, one Intercontinental Cup.Zinedine Zidane was one beautiful wizard with a ball at his feet.Headbutts aside, Zizou was the most elegant football of all time, pirouetting his way around Europe; usually winning while doing so.When he won, it was usually after he'd scored one of the most memorable goals of all time. Three World Cup final goals and the best goal in UEFA Champions League history in the 2002 final, it's fair to say that Zidane wasn't just one of the most entertaining players of all time, but also one of the most 'clutch'.5. Johan CruyffPeak: 1971-75Major Achievements: 1971, 1973 & 1975 Ballon d'Or, 1974 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, three-time Dutch Footballer of the Year, two-time Dutch Sportsman of the Year, three European Cups, one La Liga title, nine Eredivisie titles, one Copa del Rey, six KNVB Cup, one Intercontinental Cup. It takes a special type of soccer to invent his own skill move, Aiden McGeady aside, obviously.It takes an even more special type of player to basically invent modern soccer.Johan Cruyff did both.A now mythical figure, Cruyff is arguably the most influential player of all time; and one of the most talented too.The centerpiece of the 'Total Football' era (shoutout to Parquet Courts), Cruyff made beautiful teams successful; a feat so incredible that we still see its effects to this day.4. Franz BeckenbauerPeak: 1966-76Major Achievements: 1972 & 1976 Ballon d'Or, FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, 1966 FIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award, four-time German Footballer of the Year, 1974 FIFA World Cup, 1972 UEFA European Championships, three European Cups, five Bundesliga titles, four DFB-Pokals, one Intercontinental Cup. While Paolo Maldini was the most complete player of the past 30 years, Franz Beckenbauer was the most complete player ever.Put simply, anything you could possibly want a player to be able to do, Beckenbauer could, and did, do it.A goalscorer: yes.An incredible defender: yes.A great athlete: yes.A consummate professional: yes.A leader: yes. In a big, big, way.A winner: yes.Known as Der Kaiser, Franz Beckenbauer was the man behind the majority of Germany's soccer triumphs over the years.Oh, he's also one of two defenders to ever win the Ballon d'Or. Oh and yes, of course he won it twice.3. PelePeak: 1958-64Major Achievements: Most career goals (of any footballer ever, like ever), FIFA Player of the Century, France Football's greatest FIFA World Cup player, TIME 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century list, Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer, Santos' all-time leading goalscorer, youngest FIFA World Cup winner, most assists in FIFA World Cup history, 1958, 1962 & 1970 FIFA World Cup, top goalscorer in FIFA World Cup finals, two Copa Libertadores titles, six Campeonato Brasilerio Serie A titles, two Intercontinental Cups, 1970 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 1958 FIFA World Cup Best Young Player, 1970 Bola de Prata. Important.It's the one word that encapsulates Pele.Pele is important.One of the 100 most important people of the 20th century according to TIME.The most important player of all time.Bursting onto the scene as a 17-year-old looking to avenge the tears of his father when Brazil lost the 1950 World Cup final, Pele would go on to win the World Cup on three separate occasions.The Brazilian's peak is fable at this point, possibly because the world didn't really get to see it due to his injury at the 1962 World Cup, but more aptly because between 1958 and 1962, no one has ever scored more goals than him.His great achievement was leading the most incredible team of all time to 1970 FIFA World Cup glory, but it's his peak years of the early 1960s which make Pele one of the very best.2. Diego Maradona Peak: 1985-90Major Achievements: 90min's Greatest Footballer of All Time, Corriere dello Sport's Best Athlete in History, 1986 FIFA World Cup, 1986 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 1985 Serie A Footballer of the Year, FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, FIFA Goal of the Century, Argentine Sports Writers' Sportsman of the Century, two-time South American Footballer of the Year, four-time Argentine Football Writers' Footballer of the Year, two Scudetti, one Coppa Italia, one Copa del Rey, one UEFA Cup. So what makes Diego Armando Maradona one of SI Soccer's greatest players of all time? Is it the fact that he won the FIFA World Cup in a way that no one else has ever been capable of doing single handedly?Is it the fact that he scored the two most significant goals in history?Is it the fact that one of these goals was the greatest goal of all time? The impossible made possible by a true genius?Is it the fact that he joined SSC Napoli - a downtrodden, unwanted, unfancied team - and made them the best team in the strongest league Europe has ever seen?Is it the fact that in his native land he is considered to be a God? A working class hero that empowered a nation through his talent?It's all of the above.Diego Maradona, at his very best, is the second-best footballer we have, and will ever see. Effective and exceptional in equal measure. 1. Lionel MessiMessi won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesPeak: 2009-12Major Achievements: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 & 2015, 2019, 2021 & 2023 Ballon d'Or, 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, Barcelona all time top goalscorer, La Liga all time top goalscorer, six-time Pichichi winner, Argentina's all time top goalscorer, most goals scored in a calendar year, 2011 & 2015 UEFA Men's Player of the Year, seven-time La Liga Player of the Year, 2014 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball, 2005 Young European Footballer of the Year, five-time European Golden Shoe winner, four Champions Leagues, 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey, two Ligue 1 titles, two Copa América titles, 2022 FIFA World Cup, Leagues Cup 2023 titleHe's extraordinary. Truly extraordinary.Certain generations identify with certain groups of players and superstars. This generation, for better or for worse, will forever be defined by Messi vs. Ronaldo. The 2022 World Cup might've ended the debate forever.

Amanda Langell | Oct 25, 2024Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's best player of all time. / IMAGO/ANPThe greatest Real Madrid players are also some of the sport's biggest superstars over the last century.At one point or another, Real Madrid has both signed and developed the best players in the world at every position. Europe's winningest club only reached unprecedented levels of success thanks to its generational players, from Alfredo Di Stéfano to Zinedine Zidane to Cristiano Ronaldo. With so many illustrious careers in Real Madrid's history, the club's best players were often separated by their silverware.Here's the 15 greatest Real Madrid players of all time.JOIN SI SOCCER'S REAL MADRID WHATSAPP COMMUNITY - GET ALL THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE15. Raymond KopaRaymond Kopa won the 1958 Ballon d'Or. / IMAGO/AlbumRaymond Kopa became the second Real Madrid player to win the Ballon d'Or award for his performances in 1958. The winger helped Los Blancos secure back-to-back La Liga titles and three consecutive European titles from 1957 to 1959.Kopa's dribbling ability, pace and vision allowed him to shine on his own despite playing alongside Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskas and Paco Gento.14. PirriPirri is one of the most versatile, relentless players to ever represent Real Madrid. Not only did he score 172 goals for Los Blancos, but he was talented enough to play in any position on the pitch, including defense. He memorably played the 1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final with his arm in a sling and the 1975 Copa del Rey final with a broken jaw.Pirri won an astonishing 10 La Liga titles with Real Madrid.13. Hugo SánchezHugo Sánchez is one of the best foreign players to ever suit up for Real Madrid. The Mexico international recorded 208 goals in 282 matches, making him one of only seven players in the club's history to score over 200 goals.Sánchez won five La Liga titles with Los Blancos and four Spanish Super Cups. He topped the La Liga scoring charts multiple times, including in 1989–90 when he bagged 38 goals.12. Luís FigoDespite his controversial transfer from Barcelona, Luís Figo proved his worth to the Madridistas in the five years he spent in Madrid. His perfectly timed assists and 57 goals for Real Madrid helped the team win two La Liga titles and the 2002 Champions League.The midfielder's trophy cabinet might not be as impressive as many of the other players on this list, but his Ballon d'Or is proof enough of his brilliant skill on the ball. The Portugal international laid the foundation for another Portuguese player who would become a legend in the sport.11. Karim Benzema Karim Benzema won the 2022 Ballon d'Or. / Kevin Jairaj-Imagn ImagesPlaying alongside one of the best players of all time was no problem for Karim Benzema. The Frenchman proved to be one of the best No. 9's in Real Madrid history, scoring 354 goals in 648 appearances. He sits just behind Cristiano Ronaldo as the club's second-leading goalscorer. Benzema also bagged 80 La Liga assists in his Real Madrid career, the most by any player to represent Los Blancos. In 2022, he won his fifth Champions League title with the club and took home the Ballon d'Or.10. Luka ModrićLuka Modrić won the Ballon d'Or in 2018. / IMAGO/AFLOSPORTThe class and quality Luka Modrić brings to the midfield is generational. He might have reached the pinnacle of his individual career when he won the Ballon d'Or in 2018, but Madridistas were singing his praises long before (and after) the prestigious award. Modrić's vision and majestic passing has created the third-most assists (56) by a Real Madrid player in La Liga, behind only Toni Kroos and Benzema. The midfielder is also one of only four players in history to win six Champions League titles.9. Santiago BernabéuSantiago Bernabéu is one of Real Madrid's most important figures, so much so that the club's stadium is named after the Spaniard. His physicality, leadership and precision in front of goal eventually earned him the captain's armband. He ended his career with 70 goals in 80 official matches.Off the pitch, Bernabéu became Real Madrid's president. He led Real Madrid from behind the scenes for 34 years and built the club into one of the sport's biggest powerhouses.8. Ferenc PuskásNot many players have an award named after them, but Ferenc Puskás does. The forward is one of the best goalscorers in the sport's history and showed his talent when he came to the biggest club in the world in 1958. Puskás scored 242 goals in 262 appearances, making him Los Blancos' sixth leading goalscorer of all time.The Hungarian won three European Cups with Real Madrid. Puskás scored seven goals in European Cup finals, the most by any player in history. Four of his goals came against Frankfurt in 1960, making him the only player to ever find the back of the net four times in a European Cup or Champions League final.7. Paco GentoDespite starting his Real Madrid career in 1953, Paco Gento still holds two incredible records with the club. The winger won 12 La Liga titles and six European Cups (now the Champions League) with Los Blancos; no other player, past or present, has more in either competition.The Spaniard's 182 goals puts him among Real Madrid's top 10 goalscorers of all time. He served as the club's honorary president until his death in 2022.6. RaúlIn the 16 years Raúl spent with Real Madrid, the striker won just about every trophy there is to win. His six La Liga titles and three Champions League titles headline his impressive resume, but it was his lethal finishing and consistency that turned him into an icon at the Santiago Bernabéu.The Spaniard is the club's third all-time leading scorer with 323 goals in a record-741 appearances. No other player in Real Madrid history has made more appearances than Raúl.5. Iker CasillasIker Casillas made 725 appearances for Real Madrid. / Joe Camporeale-Imagn ImagesEvery goalkeeper that follows in Iker Casillas' footsteps has an impossible legacy to live up to. The Spaniard won his first Champions League title just days after he turned 19 years old and went on to win two more with Real Madrid.In his prime, Casillas was the best goalkeeper in the world and routinely delivered elite performances between the posts to help Real Madrid claim title after title. He remains Los Blancos' second-most capped player of all time with 725 career appearances.4. Zinedine ZidaneZinedine Zidane (left) is one of Real Madrid's greatest midfielders and managers. / GEPA/Imagn ImagesZinedine Zidane's name holds a special weight among soccer fans across the globe, not just Madridistas. The Frenchman is one of the sport's greatest midfielders; the control, skill and creativity Zidane brought to the pitch looked effortless and almost otherworldly.Despite only spending five years as a Real Madrid player, the midfielder cemented his legacy with his stunning volley in the 2001 Champions League final. To this day, the goal is one of the competition's best.His legend status at the Santiago Bernabéu only grew when he returned as a manager to lead Real Madrid to the first ever Champions League three-peat from 2016 to 2018.3. Sergio RamosSergio Ramos is the greatest Real Madrid defender of all time. / Kevin Jairaj-Imagn ImagesThe best defender to ever don the Real Madrid crest is Sergio Ramos. The captain's ruthless—sometimes borderline—aggression led Los Blancos' backline for almost two decades. Ramos' heroics in his own half helped the club win four Champions League titles and five La Liga titles.He is remembered for so much more than his defending, though. The Spaniard's goal in dying seconds of the 2014 Champions League final will forever be one of his and the club's greatest moments. Ramos is also Real Madrid's 20th all-time leading scorer with 101 goals in 671 appearances.2. Alfredo Di StéfanoAlfredo Di Stéfano's resume is as impressive as they come. The Argentine's 308 goals helped Real Madrid win five European Cups and eight La Liga titles during his 11-year stint with the club. He even found the back of the net in all five of Real Madrid's victorious European Cup finals.Over 60 years after he stopped playing for Los Blancos, Di Stéfano still remains the club's fourth all-time leading goalscorer. In fact, he would have remained atop the list had Raúl, Benzema, and the club's best player not come along. 1. Cristiano RonaldoCristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's all-time leading goalscorer. / IMAGO/ANPWas there ever any doubt about the greatest Real Madrid player? Cristiano Ronaldo's legacy and achievements might never be topped, at least not anytime soon. The Portugal captain is the club's all-time leading scorer with 450 goals in 438 appearances.Ronaldo added four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey titles, three FIFA Club World Cups and more to his overflowing trophy cabinet during his time in Madrid. He also won four Ballon d'Or awards for his heroics while representing Los Blancos.READ THE LATEST REAL MADRID NEWS, PREVIEWS, PREDICTIONS, TRANSFER RUMORS AND MOREfeedPublished Oct 23, 2024|Modified Oct 25, 2024AMANDA LANGELLAmanda Langell is a Sports Illustrated Soccer freelance writer covering the European game and international competitions.Follow AmandaLangellHome/SoccerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTakedown PolicyTerms and ConditionsSI Accessibility StatementSitemapA-Z IndexFAQCookie Settings© 2025 ABG-SI LLC - SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

Ranking the 50 Best Soccer Forwards of All Time ON SISI SWIMSUITSI TICKETSSI RESORTSSI SHOPSMY ACCOUNTSUBSCRIBE NOWMARCH MADNESSNFLNBAWNBANCAABNCAAFMLBSOCCERGOLFMEDIABETTINGFANTASYThe 50 Best Soccer Forwards of All Time: RankedFrom Pelé to Puskas, and from Batistuta to Benzema, these are soccer's most elite-ever forwards. Barnaby Lane | Feb 7, 2025Cristiano Ronaldo. / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesIn soccer, the primary job of any forward is to score goals.That being said, truly great forwards do more than just find the back of the net. They do so with aplomb and when it matters most.They also know how to dribble past opposition players with silky skills, and, though sometimes difficult, when to tee up their teammates instead of trying to take the headlines.Here, Sports Illustrated has ranked the 50 best forwards in soccer history. We've positioned each player based on a combination of number of career goals, longevity, honors won, big game performances, and, most importantly, all-round soccer ability.The players included on this list either do, or did, play as a traditional striker, or second striker, at some point in their career. We've excluded wingers such as Mohamed Salah and George Best. 50. Ruud van NistelrooyRuud van Nistelrooy was good at scoring goals. / GEPA/Imagn ImagesRuud van Nistelrooy was the sort of striker that needed just one chance to score.The Dutch forward averaged a goal every 128 minutes in the Premier League during his time at Manchester United, scoring 95 in just five seasons before moving to Real Madrid.In Spain, he boasted an equally impressive record, netting 64 goals in 96 games, winning LaLiga twice and the Spanish Super Cup. 49. Hernán CrespoHernán Crespo scored an impressive 307 goals for club and country during his career, most of which came during his time in Italy with Parma, Lazio, and Inter Milan.Had it not been for a series of injuries and a disappointing spell in England with Chelsea, that total would probably have been higher.48. Radamel FalcaoRadamel Falcao is nicknamed "El Tigre." / Jonathan Dyer-Imagn ImagesRadamel Falcao is nicknamed "El Tigre" (The Tiger) because of his ferocious finishing abilities. Superb in the air and boasting a cannon of a right cleat, the 38-year-old has scored almost 350 goals for club and country across successful spells in Argentina, Portugal, Spain, and France.The less said about his time in England with Chelsea and Manchester United, however, the better. 47. Arsenio EricoArsenio Erico is the all-time top goalscorer in the Argentine first division with 295 goals, all of which were scored for Club Atlético Independiente.Nicknamed the "Red Jumper" because of his ability to hang in the air and head the ball, in 1932, the Paraguay striker was offered a tidy sum of money to lead Argentina out at the World Cup. He turned it down, however, and because Paraguay didn't play in a major international tournament during his career, it means he's the only player on this list to have never played a competitive international game.46. Andriy ShevchenkoBefore his failed spell at Chelsea (you're probably starting to see a pattern here), Andriy Shevchenko was one of European soccer's most revered strikers.During his seven seasons in Italy with AC Milan between 1999 and 2006, the Ukraine international scored 173 goals in 296 games, winning both Serie A and the Champions League.He remains the Rossoneri's second highest all time goalscorer, behind Gunnar Nordahl.45. Silvio PiolaItalian soccer legend Silvio Piola has two soccer stadiums named after him in his home country, which makes sense given that he scored 339 goals there between 1929 and 1954.Piola also scored a brace in the 1938 FIFA World Cup final to help Italy beat Hungary 4-2. 44. Hugo SánchezA quick glance at Hugo Sánchez's goalscoring statistics is enough to explain why he makes this list.The Mexican striker scored no less than 513 goals during his career, including 208 in 282 games for Real Madrid between 1985 and 1992.Despite having retired almost three decades ago, he remains LaLiga's fifth highest scorer ever.43. Emilio ButragueñoEmilio Butragueño was the standout star in a homegrown Real Madrid side that dominated Spanish football in the second half of the 1980s, winning five consecutive LaLiga titles.Nicknamed "El Buitre" (The Vulture) due to his ability to snatch up chances, Butragueño scored 170 goals during 12 seasons at the Santiago Bernabeu.42. Samuel Eto'oSamuel Eto'o for Cameroon. / Witters Sport-Imagn ImagesSamuel Eto'o was the face of African football in the noughties, during which time he enjoyed successful spells with Mallorca, FC Barcelona, and Inter Milan.He won the Champions League with both of the latter, and finished his career in 2019 with 421 goals for club and country.41. Erling HaalandErling Haaland in action for Manchester City. / Kyle Robertson/Columbus Dispatch, Kyle Robertson / USA TODAY NETWORKSince bursting onto the scene with RB Salzburg in 2019, Erling Haaland has broken record, after record, after record.At just 24 years old, he's already the Premier League's single-season record scorer, having hit 36 in 38 games during 2022–23, while he's also the fastest and youngest player to ever score 40 Champions League goals.To date, he's hit 300 goals for club and country.Keep going at the rate he is, and the Norwegian will one day find himself much higher up this list. 40. Harry KaneHarry Kane. / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesHarry Kane is as clinical as they come in front of goal. Both Tottenham Hotspur's and England's all-time top scorer, he's scored well over 400 career goals, including 64 in just 63 for new club Bayern Munich, whom he joined in the summer of 2023.The only thing that holds him back from being higher on this list is the fact that he's never won a trophy. 39. George WeahBefore he became the President of Liberia in 2018, George Weah was actually one of world soccer's most lauded forwards.A physical specimen with ballerina's feet, he racked up 193 career goals in spells with AS Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, Chelsea, Manchester City, and Marseille. He also remains the only African player to ever win the Ballon d'Or, having scooped world soccer's most esteemed individual prize in 1995. 38. Paolo RossiMainly due to injuries and a infamous ban for match fixing, Paolo Rossi's peak was relatively short. When fit and not serving time on the sidelines, however, the Italian was a force to be reckoned with.Agile, elegant, and prolific in front of goal, his finest hour came at the 1982 World Cup, where he scored six goals, including a hat-trick against Brazil and one in the final against West Germany, as Italy lifted the trophy. 37. Robin van PersieRobin van Persie in action for the Netherlands. / Witters Sport-Imagn ImagesHas there ever been a soccer player who could volley a ball as well as Robin van Persie? We'd argue not.Just watch his superb strike for Manchester United against Aston Villa in 2013. Or his wonder goal for Arsenal against Charlton Athletic in 2006.The list goes on. 36. Alan ShearerAlan Shearer wasn't always pretty to watch, but was he effective.Capable of scoring with both feet and his head, as well both in the penalty box and from range, the Englishman is the Premier League's all time top scorer with 260 goals.It's a quite astonishing total that doesn't look like it will be matched anytime soon.35. Kylian MbappéKylian Mbappé in action for France. / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesKylian Mbappé may not have enjoyed a great start to life at Real Madrid, but there's no denying his quality. One of modern soccer's best goalscorers, the Frenchman, despite being just 25 years old, has already scored well over 300 goals for club and country, including 256 goals in seven seasons at Paris Saint-Germain.He's also a World Cup winner.On his day, he's nigh impossible to stop thanks to his Bolt-esque pace and superb ball control. 34. RivaldoRivaldo sits on the pantheon of Brazilian greats.Known for his wiry strength, penchant for acrobatic goals, and, on occasion, play acting, the former FC Barcelona star scored over 400 goals during his career, and won almost all there is to win in world soccer including the World Cup, the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or. 33. Jimmy GreavesA Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur legend (not many players can say that), Jimmy Greaves scored a combined 344 goals in the English top flight for the two London clubs between 1957 and 1970.He also won the World Cup with England in 1966, but was famously robbed of a place in the final by injury. Fortunately for the Three Lions, his replacement, Geoff Hurst, scored a hat-trick.32. Alessandro Del PieroThe look of love. / LuzzaniWhether playing as a striker, second striker, attacking midfielder, or even a right-winger, Alessandro Del Piero was always a threat.Blessed with incredibly technical ability, lovely feet, and a scorching right cleat, the Italian scored 343 goals during his career, most of which were for Juventus between 1993 and 2012.31. Jean-Pierre PapinJean-Pierre Papin won league titles with Marseille, Milan, and Bayern Munich during a career that saw him score almost 400 goals.The Frenchman was also awarded the Ballon d'Or in 1991, pipping Red Star Belgrade duo Dejan Savicevic and Darko Pancev to the prize. 30. Didier DrogbaDidier Drogba ended his career in the MLS. / Kevin Sousa-Imagn ImagesDidier Drogba was the ultimate big game forward. During his time at Chelsea, the Ivorian scored nine goals in nine finals, including three winners in FA Cup finals and a crucial equalizer against Bayern Munich in the final of the 2012 Champions League as the Blues lifted the trophy for the first time ever.Former Barcelona defender Gerard Pique previously called Drogba "one of the best strikers I have seen," and he knows a thing or two.29. Uwe SeelerUwe Seeler, who scored well over 500 goals during his career, is the holder of a number of impressive World Cup records.The former West Germany forward was the first player ever to appear in 20 World Cup matches, the first score at four World Cups, and the first player to score at least two goals at four World Cups.For all his trying, however, he was never able to win it, finishing second in 1966 and third in 1970.28. Zlatan IbrahimovićZlatan Ibrahimovic played for LA Galaxy in 2018 and 2019. / Brace Hemmelgarn-Imagn ImagesOne of soccer's true mavericks, Zlatan Ibrahimović's highlight reel is truly something to behold.From karate kicks to back heels, to bicycle kicks to net-busting volleys, the Swede has scored every type of goal imaginable, and lots of them, too.In nearly 1,000 games for club and country, he found the net 573 times. 27. Karl-Heinz RummeniggeKarl-Heinz Rummenigge did it all and won it all as a Bayern Munich player.During his 10 seasons at the Allianz Arena, the German forward scored 217 goals, lifting the Bundesliga title, German Cup and European Cup twice each.For West Germany, he almost won it all too.Though he lifted the European Championship in 1980, he twice fell short at the final hurdle at the World Cup, coming out on the losing end in both the 1982 and 1986 finals. 26. Gabriel BatistutaGabriel Batistuta at Fiorentina. / IMAGO / WEREKNothing tickles the fancy of a true soccer fan than the sight of the great Gabriel Batistuta in a purple Fiorentina kit. Known as "Batigol," he scored 203 goals in 331 games for the Italian side between 1991 and 2000, as well as 33 more in a brief spell at AS Roma as he helped them lift the Serie A title in 2001.Batistuta also netted 56 goals in 78 appearances for Argentina. A return that makes him country's second top scorer of all time behind only Lionel Messi.25. RaúlRaúl is Real Madrid through and through.Born in Madrid, he's the club's record appearance holder with 741, as well its second all time top scorer with 323 goals. He's now the manager of Real's reserve team.Hala Madrid, as they say.24. Karim BenzemaKarim Benzema is a Real Madrid legend. / Kevin Jairaj-Imagn ImagesLike Raul, Karim Benzema is a bona fide Real Madrid legend.The Frenchman is the club's fifth most-capped player of all time, having made 648 appearances for Los Blancos between 2009 and 2023. He's also their second top scorer ever with 354 goals, a total bettered only by Cristiano Ronaldo.Did we mention that during his time at Madrid he also won four LaLiga titles, five Champions Leagues and the Ballon d'Or? 23. David VillaDavid Villa. / Brad Penner-Imagn ImagesDavid Villa scored 382 club goals during a stellar career which saw him enjoy spells with FC Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and MLS outfit New York City FC.His most notable achievements, however, were for his country.Villa's is Spain's record goalscorer hit 59 goals in 98 games, and finished top scorer at the 2008 European Championships and 2010 World Cup, both of which La Roja won. 22. Wayne RooneyRoon-eh, Roon-eh! / Anne-Marie Sorvin-Imagn ImagesWayne Rooney is often criminally overlooked when people talk about the greatest Premier League players of all time. But that's exactly what he was.A five-time title winner, Rooney scored 253 goals in all competitions for Manchester United between 2004 and 2017 making him the club's record goalscorer.The Englishman was far more than just a goal getter, however. He also worked harder than anyone on the pitch and was revered for his passion, even if it did boil over from time to time. 21. Hristo StoichkovHristo Stoichkov was one of, if not the, best striker in world soccer in the late 1980s and early '90s.During his last three seasons at CSKA Sofia and his first spell at FC Barcelona, the Bulgarian racked up 210 goals in just 332 games.In 1994, after scoring six goals to help Bulgaria reach the semifinals of the World Cup, he was awarded the Ballon d'Or. 20. Antoine GriezmannAntoine Griezmann. / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesGiven his tendency to do silly Fortnite dances when he scores, it's sometimes easy to forget that Antoine Griezmann is a serious baller.Across spells with Real Sociedad, FC Barcelona, and Atlético Madrid, he's scored an impressive 274 goals, while he's also notched 44 for France.Perhaps most impressively, however, is that, unlike some on this list, he's equally as good at teeing up his teammates.To date, he boasts over 150 career assists.19. Sergio AgüeroAgüero was one of the most lethal strikers in the sport. / Mike DiNovo-Imagn ImagesSergio Agüero, who retired in 2021, was a defender's nightmare thanks to his short, stocky build, low center of gravity, and sharp movement in-and-around the penalty box. He was also pretty good at scoring goals.In fact, he scored 426 of them during his career, 260 of which were for Manchester City. Most famously, he scored the dramatic late goal that won City its first-ever Premier League title in 2012.A statue of Agüero celebrating that iconic goal now stands outside City's stadium.18. Gunnar NordahlGoals, goals, and more goals would be a quick and accurate way to surmise Gunnar Nordahl's career.The Swede scored exactly 500 of them during his career, including 221 for AC Milan, a figure which is yet to be beaten. 17. Robert LewandowskiThey call him Robert LewanGOALski. / Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn ImagesRobert Lewandowski scored an astonishing 447 goals in just 562 games during his time in Germany with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.As is ever the case for anyone who scores tons of goals in the Bundesliga, however, the question always remained: "Can he do it in a bigger league?"The answer is yes. Since moving to FC Barcelona in 2022, the prolific Pole has continued to find the net an astounding rate, scoring 81 times in 115 games.16. Luis SuárezLuis Suarez, "El Pistolero." / Sam Navarro-Imagn ImagesAlongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, Luis Suárez can lay claim to being part of the most feared and fruitful attacking trio in soccer history.From the start of the 2014/15 season to the end of 2016/17, the three scored a combined total of 363 goals, 121 of which came courtesy of the Uruguayan.Add those goals to the 393 others he's scored outside of those three seasons, and Suárez stands tall as one of soccer's greatest-ever goal getters, whether alone or with his buddies. 15. Kenny DalglishKenny Dalglish wasn't particularly athletic. He wasn't fast, strong, nor did he run around the pitch like a mad man.What he was, however, was a genius.Supremely skillful with a brilliant footballing brain, the Scotsman was the crown jewel in a Liverpool side that dominated European soccer in the late 1970s and '80s, winning six league titles and three European Cups. 14. Josef BicanGiven he retired from professional soccer in 1957, you'd be forgiven for not knowing who Josef Bican is.Don't worry, we'll fill you in.An Austrian-Czechoslovakian forward who spent most of his career with Slavia Prague, Bican was known for his poise, power, and, most of all, his considerable pace.He was reported to have been able to run the 100m in just 10.8 seconds.Bican scored goals in similarly quick fashion, netting 809 in only 526 career games. 13. Marco van BastenOne of Dutch soccer's greatest-ever players, Marco van Basten scored 307 goals, and won three Ballon d'Ors, four Serie A titles, and two European Cups during a glittering career that was cut short at just 28 by injury.Had that not happened, it's scary to think what he might have gone on to achieve. 12. Thierry HenryVa Va Voom. / Brad Mills-Imagn ImagesThierry Henry is widely regarded as the Premier League's best-ever player, and rightly so.A joy to watch, the Arsenal legend was lightening fast, insanely skillful, and had an eye for goal that was second-to-none scoring 226 goals in 370 games for the Gunners.His trademark finish of opening his right cleat and placing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal is the stuff of English top flight folklore. 11. RomárioRomário once claimed to be "twice" as good as both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.While, of course, wrong, the Brazilian really was some player during his heyday.One of the most lethal finishers of all time, Romário officially hit 756 goals during his career, though he claims it was actually more than 1,000.10. Alfredo Di StéfanoInstead of telling you just how good Alfredo Di Stéfano was, we'll let George Best do it instead."The most complete player I ever saw," Best once said of the Real Madrid legend. "It seemed to me could do absolutely everything," he explained. "He could score goals, he could defend, he was good in the air, with both feet, exciting to watch."Scoring goals was Di Stefano's speciality. He scored 509 in a career that saw him win eight LaLiga titles, five European Cups and two Ballon d'Ors.9. EusébioBorn in Mozambique but molded in the Portuguese city of Lisbon, Eusébio is both an African and European soccer icon.Over the course of his career, most of which he spent with Benfica, the "Black Pearl" scored 638 goals in 614 games, won the European Cup, fired Portugal to a third-place finished at the World Cup and lifted the Ballon d'Or.When he died in 2014, Portugal went into three days of mourning."For us, for you, Eusébio is one of the greatest footballers in the history of football, especially for people from our generation and older than us," Portuguese manager José Mourinho said at the time. "He's at this level: Eusébio, Charlton, Pelé," he added.8. Ferenc PuskásIn the 1940s and 50s, Ferenc Puskás, known as "The Galloping Major" because of his rank in the Hungarian army, ripped up the top flight in his home country to the tune of 358 goals in just 350 games for Budapest Honved.At 31, he moved to Real Madrid and proved that age is just a number, scoring another 242 times over the next eight years. He ended his career having won three European Cups, five LaLiga titles and an Olympic Gold medal.The FIFA Puskás Award, which is awarded to the soccer player judged to have scored the best goal of the year, is also named after him.7. Gerd MüllerGerd Müller scored 565 goals in just 607 games for Bayern Munich between 1965 and 1979, which perfectly demonstrates explains why he was nicknamed "Der Bomber."No less than 66 of those goals came in one season in 1972–73, which, unsurprisingly, remains the a club record.Müller also scored 68 goals in 62 international appearances for West Germany, including the winner in the 1974 World Cup final.A German soccer legend. 6. PeléPelé. / Brad Penner-Imagn ImagesPele died in 2022 as the greatest goalscorer in soccer history.Whether he really was, or how many goals he scored exactly, is up for debate, but his legacy remains unmatched.Soccer's first global superstar, Pele's samba style and flair revolutionized the sport, transfixing spectators and mesmerizing defenders across the globe.Because of his rags to riches story, he was also a symbol of Brazilian emancipation, and he remains the only player in soccer history to have ever won three World Cups."He's the pioneer. He's Elvis. He's Neil Armstrong. He's the first to do it," David Tryhorn, the co-director of "Pele," a Netflix documentary about the star's life and career, once said.5. Cristiano RonaldoNobody finds the net like Cristiano Ronaldo. / Yukihito Taguchi-Imagn ImagesIt's hard, if not impossible, to argue that there has ever been a soccer player as good at simply putting the ball in the net than Cristiano Ronaldo.The Portuguese icon is the sport's highest scorer of all time, having found the net over 900 times for club and country, including on 450 occasions for Real Madrid between 2009 and 2017.Whether scoring with his head, right foot or left foot, Ronaldo could, and can still, do it all. 4. RonaldoRonaldo was simply unstoppable at his peak.Known for his blistering pace, dazzling feet, and second-to-none finishing (including his trademark dribbling rounding the goalkeeper), the Brazilian legend managed 352 club goals across spells in the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy. He also scored 62 goals for Brazil, including 15 at World Cups, lifting the trophy twice. 3. Johan CruyffNo player has had as big of an impact on soccer as its played on the pitch than Johan Cruyff. As a player, and later as a coach, he introduced the world to the art of Total Football: A tactical system that centered around the creation of space through players moving freely between positions.Later refined, and arguably perfected, by Pep Guardiola, the philosophy is now a staple of the game for team's all over the world, from Brighton to FC Barcelona.Legacy aside, Cruyff was a great forward, too. A three-time Ballon d'Or winner, he scored 433 goals during his impressive playing career, mostly for Ajax and Barca. 2. Diego MaradonaDiego Maradona was Argentina's head coach between 2008 and 2010. / Witters Sport-Imagn ImagesDiego Maradona didn't just kick the ball, he caressed it, keeping it so close to his feet at all times that it was near impossible for the opposition to take it from him. That supernatural ball control was best showcased while playing for Argentina against England in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup, when he dribbled past five outfield players and the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into an empty net. La Albiceleste went on to win the tournament and the strike was later voted as the "Goal of the Century."A true soccer genius, Maradona walked (or in this case, dribbled) so Lionel Messi could run.1. Lionel MessiLionel Messi is soccer's GOAT. / Sam Navarro-Imagn ImagesLionel Messi is not only the greatest forward in soccer history, he's the sport's best-ever player.The magical Argentine did things with the ball that mere mortals could only dream of during his 17 seasons with FC Barcelona, often dribbling past hoards of defenders like they weren't even there before finding the net. Something he did a record 672 times for the Catalan club.An eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, he's won no less than 43 major team honors during his career, most notably the 2022 World Cup, where he scored twice in the final as Argentina lifted the trophy for the first time since his idol Maradona did in 1986.In the words of the great Ray Hudson: "They tell me that all men are equal in God's eyes, this player makes you seriously think about those words."READ MORE ON THE GREATEST IN SOCCERmanualPublished Dec 2, 2024|Modified Feb 7, 2025BARNABY LANEBarnaby Lane is a highly experienced sports writer who has written for The Times, FourFourTwo Magazine, TalkSPORT, and Business Insider.

Best Soccer Goalkeepers of All Time ON SISI SWIMSUITSI TICKETSSI RESORTSSI SHOPSMY ACCOUNTSUBSCRIBE NOWMARCH MADNESSNFLNBAWNBANCAABNCAAFMLBSOCCERGOLFMEDIABETTINGFANTASYBest Soccer Goalkeepers of All TimeFormer Spain and Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas won his first Champions League title just days after his 19th birthday. Amanda Langell | Feb 7, 2025Check out the best soccer goalkeepers of all time. / IMAGO/ABACAPRESSGoalkeepers might not get the same recognition as soccer's best goalscorers or even the sport's elite defenders, but they play as integral role as any other position in leading a team to championship glory. From current goalkeepers taking over the game like Alisson and Thibaut Courtois to legendary figures like Lev Yashin and Sepp Maier, the all-time greats between the posts have the ability to singlehandedly change the course of a match. The best of the best, though, did so for both club and country.Here's the 15 greatest goalkeepers in history.15. Dino ZoffDino Zoff won the 1982 FIFA World Cup with Italy. / IMAGO/Varley MediaDino Zoff announced himself as one of Europe's best goalkeepers in the 1970s with his success at Juventus. The Italian won six Serie A titles and two Coppa Italia titles in an 11-year span.He truly left his mark on the pitch, though, for Italy. After falling short at the 1970 FIFA World Cup to Brazil, Zoff got his chance at redemption 12 years later at the age of 40. The goalkeeper led Italy to its third World Cup and its first since 1938.Like another Italian goalkeeper on our list, Zoff never secured a Champions League title.14. Gordon BanksGordon Banks might have only won one EFL Cup with Leicester City and one with Stoke City in his domestic career, but his time with England is what makes him one of the all-time greats. The goalkeeper was between the posts for every one of the Three Lions' matches at the 1966 FIFA World Cup that ended with England winning its first and only World Cup.Banks and England could not repeat their success at the 1970 World Cup, but he still left his mark on the tournament; Banks's save against Brazil's Pelé is a highlight of his career.13. Thibaut CourtoisThibaut Courtois won two Champions League titles with Real Madrid. / IMAGO/PanoramiCWithout Thibaut Courtois, Real Madrid would not have won the 2022 Champions League final. The goalkeeper put forth one of the best performances in UCL final history against Liverpool, recording nine saves and keeping a clean sheet. The Belgian became just the third goalkeeper to ever be named Man of the Match in a UCL final.Courtois also won the 2024 Champions League with Los Blancos and three La Liga titles. He also became a Spanish champion with Atlético Madrid and topped the Premier League twice with Chelsea.Although he never managed to secure any international trophies, Courtois did take home the Golden Glove from the 2018 FIFA World Cup after Belgium finished third.12. Sepp MaierSepp Maier is the first of several German legends on our list. The goalkeeper won Euro 1972 with West Germany and then the World Cup just two years later. Maier received the German Footballer of the Year award for his efforts in 1975 before claiming the honor again in 1977 and 1978.Maier's international achievements joined his long list of domestic successes with Bayern Munich. He made 709 appearances for the German giants, a club record that Thomas Müller eventually surpassed in 2024. The German was a four-time Bundesliga champion, a three-time Champions League winner and a four-time DFB-Pokal champion.11. Andoni ZubizarretaAndoni Zubizarreta is remembered as one of the best Spanish goalkeepers in history. Although he enjoyed a majority of his success with Barcelona, he won two La Liga titles, a Spanish Super Cup and a Copa del Rey with Athletic Club before he even made the move to Catalonia.Once he joined the Spanish giants, he built his long-lasting legacy. He secured four La Liga titles, one Champions League, two Spanish Super Cups and two Copa Del Rey trophies all within seven years at the club. 10. David SeamanDavid Seaman might not have been a member of The Invincibles, but he still contributed to plenty of Arsenal's biggest accomplishments. The former England international won three Premier League titles with the Gunners, four FA Cups and one EFL Cup.He also made the second-most appearances for the Three Lions in history with 75 caps. His international career did not bring any silverware, though, and his blunder against Ronaldinho in the 2002 FIFA World Cup marred his time in an England shirt. 9. AlissonAlisson won the 2019 Champions League with Liverpool. / IMAGO/SportsphotoAlisson is the first active goalkeeper to make the top 10. The Brazilian shows up for Liverpool time and time again, pulling out heroic saves that helped the Reds claim the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League one year later.The shot-stopper also emerged as one of the only constants for an up-and-down Brazil team over the years. His efforts between the posts helped the Seleção win the 2019 Copa América, Brazil's first in over a decade.Alisson could very well move up our rankings if the goalkeeper manages to snag more silverware with Liverpool or Brazil.8. Oliver KahnBefore Manuel Neuer, there was Oliver Kahn. The German made 86 appearances for his country and walked away with the Golden Ball at the 2002 FIFA World Cup despite falling short to Brazil. For Bayern Munich, the goalkeeper won just about all there is to win. With eight Bundesliga titles, a Champions League and six DFB-Pokal titles, Kahn remains one of the most successful German goalkeepers in history.7. Edwin van der SarEdwin van der Sar was a four-time Dutch champion and a Champions League winner with Ajax all before he transferred to Manchester United. Then, under Sir Alex Ferguson, the goalkeeper won four Premier League titles and another Champions League.Titles aside, Van der Sar holds the world record for the longest time without conceding a goal in a league match. The Dutchman went 1,311 minutes without letting in a single goal for United between Nov. 2008 and Mar. 2009.6. Petr ČechPetr Čech's illustrious career at Chelsea makes him one of the best Premier League goalkeepers in history. Despite a serious head injury, Čech still delivered great performance after great performance, helping the Blues win four Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League and four FA Cups. He remains the seventh-most capped player in Chelsea history with 494 appearances.Even when Čech transferred to Arsenal, he still added more titles to his trophy cabinet, winning the FA Cup in 2017. His lack of international silverware has him just out of our top five.5. Peter SchmeichelPeter Schmeichel helped pull off one of the biggest upsets in history at Euro 1992. The goalkeeper kept a clean sheet against Germany, leading Denmark to its first and only European championship. The international achievement alone etched Schmeichel in the goalkeeping history books, but his time at Manchester United made him one of the best goalkeepers of all time. The former Red Devil won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, three FA Cups and more with United before enjoying spells at Sporting CP, Aston Villa and Manchester City.4. Manuel NeuerManuel Neuer won the 2014 FIFA World Cup with Germany. / Denny Medley-Imagn ImagesIt goes without saying that Manuel Neuer redefined the position forever as he emerged as the best sweeper keeper in the game. The German international cemented his legacy at the 2014 FIFA World Cup when he helped Germany win the tournament, taking home the Golden Glove for his heroic efforts. The goalkeeper also finished as a Ballon d'Or finalist later that year.Neuer also topped the Bundesliga 11 times and the Champions League twice in 2013 and 2020 with Bayern Munich. So much of Bayern Munich's success comes from Neuer's performances between the posts; the former German international has most clean sheets in Bundesliga history, a statistic he is still adding to till this day.3. Lev YashinLev Yashin has something no other goalkeeper has—a Ballon d'Or. The goalkeeper took home soccer's most prestigious award in 1963 and no other player at his position has since matched the feat. Beyond the individual honor, Yashin won Euro 1960 with the Soviet Union and became a five-time Soviet Champion with Dinamo Moscow. He took home an Olympic gold medal as well.Yashin's groundbreaking career led to the Yashin Trophy, awarded to the best goalkeeper every year at the Ballon d'Or ceremony.2. Gianluigi BuffonGianluigi Buffon's reputation precedes him. The goalkeeper won a staggering 10 Serie A titles with Juventus, along with six Coppa Italia titles and seven Italian Super Cups. Even when he left the Italian giants, he still racked up silverware, winning Ligue 1 and the French Super Cup with PSG.Of course, one of the highlights of Buffon's career came at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He played an integral role in Italy's campaign that ended with the country's fourth World Cup.Buffon was never able to claim a Champions League trophy, though, leaving him just behind our pick for the best goalkeeper of all time. 1. Iker CasillasIker Casillas made 725 appearances for Real Madrid. / Joe Camporeale-Imagn ImagesNot only is Iker Casillas the best goalkeeper to ever represent Real Madrid and Spain, but he is also the one of the best soccer players of all time. The Spaniard was the pillar of La Roja's four-year dominance from 2008 to 2012 that ended with two European Championships and a World Cup.His trophy cabinet also contains three Champions League titles, including the one he won just days after he turned 19 years old. He collected five La Liga titles, four Spanish Super Cups and two UEFA Super Cups with Real Madrid as well.Casillas remains the goalkeeper with the most Champions League appearances of all time (177) and is second to only Raúl in Real Madrid appearances with 725.

Ranking The 25 Best Soccer Midfielders of All Time ON SISI SWIMSUITSI TICKETSSI RESORTSSI SHOPSMY ACCOUNTSUBSCRIBE NOWMARCH MADNESSNFLNBAWNBANCAABNCAAFMLBSOCCERGOLFMEDIABETTINGFANTASYRanking the 25 Best Soccer Midfielders of All TimeZinedine Zidane, Andrea Pirlo, and N'Golo Kante are among soccer's best-ever midfielders, at least according to us. Barnaby Lane | Feb 7, 2025Andres Iniesta is one of the best midfielder's of all-time. / Kevin Jairaj-Imagn ImagesIn soccer, midfielders come in all shapes and sizes.Some excel in passing, able to drive the ball the length of the field or slide in killer through-balls into spaces unseen by the opposition.Others are instead better at tackling, stopping their opposing number dead in their tracks to help keep in-tact that all important clean sheet.Some even work in the shadows, appearing from the outside to be doing very little, but to the trained eye, masterfully dictating the tempo of a match like a human metronome. Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the 25 best to ever do it, regardless of their chosen niche. 25. Juan Román RiquelmeJuan Riquelme was no match for most defensive midfielders. / Jerry Lai-Imagn ImagesJuan Riquelme was perhaps the last of his kind. He was a bit slow, and wasn't really blessed with any standout physical attributes, but what he lacked in build, he more than made up for in ability.A supreme technician, the Argentine, who is best remembered in Europe for his time at Spanish club Villarreal, could unlock any defense with his dazzling feet and eagle-like eye for a pass. Though his style wouldn't cut it in the modern day, it was a thing of beauty at the time. 24. Frank LampardFrank Lampard ended his career in the MLS with New York City FC. / Vincent Carchietta-Imagn ImagesMidfielders aren't generally expected to score a lot of goals, but it's always a bonus when they do.Frank Lampard was a master of that art.In just over 1,000 games for club and country, the Englishman scored a mightily impressive 303 goals, most of which were Chelsea, with whom he spent the majority of his domestic career.He retired in 2017 as the Blues' record goalscorer and the Premier League's highest-scoring midfielder of all-time. 23. Steven GerrardSteven Gerrard. / Brad Penner-Imagn ImagesSteven Gerrard and Frank Lampard were often pitted against each other during their time together in the Premier League.However, while Lampard was the more talented attacker of the two, Gerrard was the better all-rounder and possessed leadership qualities that his English compatriot lacked.Lampard was always surrounded by world class players during his time at Chelsea, but at Liverpool, Gerrard would often find himself lining up alongside the likes of El Hadji Diouf and Djimi Traoré. Nevertheless, he'd still drag Liverpool through the mud with his explosive, box-to-box displays, seemingly doing the job of an entire team on his own at times.22. Luis Suárez No, not the Luis Suárez who is currently tearing up Major League Soccer alongside Lionel Messi at Inter Miami, but the Spanish midfielder who won the Ballon d'Or in 1960.Like his namesake, Suárez also played for FC Barcelona, where he won two LaLiga titles in 1959 and 1960 before moving to Inter Milan. In Italy, he won a further three league titles, as well as two European Cups. The Spaniard, who was nicknamed "The Architect" by Alfredo Di Stefano because of his playmaking skills, was also a part of the Spain squad that won the European Championships in 1964.21. N'Golo KanteDuring his heyday, they used to say that “70% of the earth is covered by water, and the rest is by N'Golo Kante."That is, of course, false. It was more like 50/50. The Frenchman ran around the pitch like he had a pack of batteries in his shorts (thanks, Claudio Ranieri), putting out fires left, right, and center, and generally just getting on every opposition players' nerves by never giving them any time to breathe. More than just a Duracell bunny in cleats, however, Kante was also a fine dribbler, solid passer, and, on occasion, goalscorer. The only player ever to win back-to-back Premier League titles with two different teams, he's also a European Champion and World Cup winner.20. Patrick VieiraPatrick Vieira. / Kirby Lee-Imagn ImagesFew sights struck as much fear into the hearts of Premier League midfielders in the noughties than the sight of a 6'4" Patrick Vieira standing across from them. A towering presence in the middle of the park both physically and metaphorically, there was little anyone could do to stop the Arsenal midfielder once he was on one of his trademark gazelle-like runs.The Frenchman was also nigh impossible to dribble past and loved a tackle, even if some of them veered on the nasty side. As close to being a "complete" midfielder as they come, Vieira won three Premier League titles with the Gunners before moving to Italy in 2006, where he would go on to win four Serie A titles with Inter Milan. He also won the World Cup in 1998.19. Clarence SeedorfClarence Seedorf remains the only player in soccer history to have won the Champions League with three different clubs, having won European soccer's most prestigious club prize with all of Ajax, Real Madrid, and AC Milan.Those achievements alone, however, don't do the Dutch midfielder justice. One of the greatest box-to-box midfielders of all-time, Seedorf could do it all, from pinging long-range passes, to making last-ditch tackles, to firing the ball into the net with his tree trunk thighs. (Seriously, you should have seen the size of them.)18. Toni KroosToni Kroos. / Kevin Jairaj-Imagn ImagesToni Kroos shocked the soccer world at the end of the 2023/24 season when he announced his surprise retirement from the sport at the age of 34.While 34 is generally not considered that early for a soccer player to call it quits, it was for Kroos, because at the time he was still one of the world's top midfielders and was showing no signs of slowing down.The Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Germany legend – who was nicknamed Garçom ("waiter" in Portuguese) because of his ability to serve up chances on plates for attackers – won it all, including five seven Champions Leagues and the World Cup.17. Johan NeeskensJohan Cruyff was the master technician that fired Ajax, FC Barcelona, and their "Total Football" to glory in the 1970s.Johan Neeskens, meanwhile, was the ying to his yang. A tireless runner who excelled in regaining possession and passing, the Dutch midfielder provided the balance and energy needed for their system to thrive. He was also good for a goal or two. In seven years alongside Cruyff at the two clubs, Neeskens won three European Cups, two Eredivisie titles, and a Copa Del Rey.The pair were also part of the Netherlands squad that finished as runners-up at the 1974 World Cup, a tournament in which Neeskens scored five goals.16. Kevin De BruyneKevin De Bruyne has won it all with Manchester City. / Maria Lysaker-Imagn ImagesThough his career is now coming to its tail end, Kevin De Bruyne has been one of world soccer's best midfielders now for almost a decade.Since moving to Manchester City in 2015, the Belgian playmaker has, with the help of his trademark whipped ball into the box and his rocket right foot, steered the Sky Blues to every major honor in world soccer, including six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, and a Champions League. A creative marvel, he's also the English top flight's second highest-ever assister with 114.15. KakaKaka. / Kim Klement-Imagn ImagesKaka's prime was relatively short, but as his best, he was truly frightening. Tall, strong, quick, and skillful, the Brazilian had real power and grace in possession, particularly when on the run, meaning he was able to glide through opposition defenses like a knife through butter.His performances for AC Milan in 2006/07, most notably in the Champions League, where he finished top scorer as the Rosseneri won the trophy, saw him win the Ballon d'Or. 14. Sergio BusquetsSergio Busquets. / Sam Navarro-Imagn ImagesAlbert Einstein once said that the "definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple.”With soccer, Sergio Busquets does just that.Unlike the atypical defensive midfielder, the Spaniard doesn't cover tons of ground, make hard-hitting tackles, or seemingly run anywhere at pace, but instead moves only himself, and the ball, when he needs to. Each touch is calculated and each pass is released just at the right time and with the perfect weight.Busqets' brilliance has often gone unnoticed, but was integral to the all-conquering Spain and Barcelona teams of the 2010s. 13. SócratesThe aptly named Sócrates was not just a soccer superstar, but also a philosopher of the game.The embodiment of Brazil's famed "joga bonito", or "play beautiful", mantra, the Brasileirão legend captivated fans with his elegant and collected style of play, as well his powerful and accurate right foot. “I see football as art,” the former midfielder, who was also a medical doctor, once said. “Today most people see football as a competition, a confrontation, a war between two polar opposites, but to start with, it is a great form of art.”12. Michael LaudrupFew players in history have dared cross the El Clasico divide and play for both FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. Michael Laudrup was one of them. Even rarer is that, because of his superb performances for the two Spanish giants, he remains adored by both sets of fans.A master creator who exuded class, "The Prince of Denmark" first won four LaLiga titles and a European Cup with Barca, before he left for Madrid following a falling out with manager Johan Cruyff. In his first season in the Spanish capital, he then inspired a previously struggling Madrid to domestic glory. 11. Luka ModrićLuka Modric. / Danielle Parhizkaran-Imagn ImagesLuka Modric broke the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo Ballon d'Or duopoly in 2018 following a stellar year for club and country, which saw him win a third consecutive Champions League title with Real Madrid and reach an unlikely World Cup final with Croatia.The midfielder, known for his luxurious footwork and devastating passing, was instrumental for his teams in achieving those respective achievements, but really, the award was the culmination of what had been a decade of domestic and international excellence.Now in his twilight years, no player in history has ever won more trophies with Madrid than Modric, who has scooped 27 in 12 years.10. Andrea PirloAndrea Pirlo. / Vincent Carchietta-Imagn ImagesFew players in history have ever looked so relaxed playing soccer as Andrea Pirlo.Seemingly unable to feel pressure and never rushed, the deep-lying Italian playmaker always appeared to have time on his hands, which, more often than not, he used to pick out a teammate with one of his trademark looping passes that he'd drop on a dime. One of just select few to ever have played for all of AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus, Pirlo won almost everything there is to win for both club and country, including six Serie A titles, two Champions Leagues, and the World Cup.9. Frank RijkaardFresh off the back of winning a load of titles in his home country with Ajax, Frank Rijkaard was brought to AC Milan in 1988 as part of coach Arrigo Sacchi's "Total Football" revolution.The move proved to be an astute one for both player and club, with Rijkard going on to help Milan win two Serie A titles, two European Cups, and a Coppa Italia across the next five seasons.A tenacious and yet composed holding midfielder with just the right amount of flair, the Dutchman won Serie A's Player of the Year award in 1992 and finished third at Ballon d'Or on two separate occasions, though in all honesty, he deserved much more individual recognition. "Dunga, Desailly, Keane and Vieira all performed that role brilliantly, but Frank is the best holding player ever," Rijkaard's Netherlands teammate Ronald Koeman previously said of him.8. Roberto BaggioThroughout his career, Roberto Baggio played as a striker, second striker, center forward, and winger. It was as an attacking midfielder, however, that he most thrived.Blessed with incredible dribbling skills, insane soccer intelligence, and one of the best first touches the game has ever seen (just ask Edwin van der Sar), the "Divine Ponytail" both scored and created goals for fun, finding the net 227 times and teeing up his teammates 152 times during a career spent entirely in his home country.Described by Pep Guardiola, a man who starred alongside the likes of Luis Figo, Romario, and Rivaldo, as the best player he's ever played with, Baggio won the Ballon d'Or in 1993.His achievements are made even more impressive by the fact that he spent most of his career playing with a dodgy knee. 7. ZicoZico is highest-scoring midfielder of all-time, having the found the net a mammoth 507 times during a career spent mostly with his boyhood club, Flamengo.A light-footed playmaker with a bag of tricks bigger than Santa's sack, the Brazilian, who was sometimes referred to has the "White Pelé", also perfected the art of the direct free-kick.He scored 101 of them, which is more than any other player in soccer history by a considerable margin. 6. Xavi HernándezXavi in action for Spain. / GEPA/Imagn ImagesOne third of what many consider to be soccer's greatest-ever midfield trio alongside Sergio Busquets and Andrés Iniesta, Xavi Hernández was a soccer puppet master.Thanks to his decisive passing and smart movement, he could switch the tempo of any game at will speeding it up to create scoring opportunities when opposition teams least expected it, and slowing it down to regain the momentum when losing control.Pulling his invisible strings, Xavi guided FC Barcelona and Spain to unprecedented glory, conquering Europe and the world with both. "If football was a science, Xavi would have discovered the formula. With a ball at his feet, no one else has ever communicated so intelligently with every player on the pitch," former Real Madrid coach Jorge Valdano once said of the Spaniard, who hung up his boots in 2019.5. Michel PlatiniKids these days will perhaps recognize Michel Platini as the former disgraced president of UEFA who was banned from soccer for eight years for ethics breaches. For older fans, however, the Frenchman is celebrated as one of the greatest players of his era.A cerebral midfield playmaker, Platini excelled in the space behind the strikers, where he created chances with precision and scored prolifically himself netting 354 goals over the course of his career.His crowning moment as a player (aside perhaps from his three Ballon d'Or wins) was at the 1984 European Championships, where he scored nine goals to fire France to glory.4. Lothar MatthäusLothar Matthäus being nicknamed after a German World War II tank ("Der Panzer") should tell you all you need to know about his all-action style of play, but we'll do it anyway.A combative but technically gifted midfielder, the Bundesliga legend was a truly dominant force in the center of the park who could switch between being a defensive enforcer and attacking threat at any moment.Those wide range of skills were best on display during Germany's 4-1 win over Yugoslavia in their opening game of the 1990 World Cup, when Matthäus scored twice from holding midfield to lay the foundations of what would go on to be a winning campaign.Also a European champion and Ballon d'Or winner, Diego Maradona once described Matthäus as the toughest opponent he ever faced, which is some compliment.3. Ruud GullitBefore he became the Ultimate Team card that every FIFA player one day dreams of packing, Ruud Gullit was one of the world's s most revered soccer players.A jack of all trades, the dreadlocked dynamo could play anywhere from sweeper to center forward, but it was in midfield where he was a master.Gullit was powerful, elegant, almost impossible to dispossess, and, as demonstrated by his 235 career goals, had habit of finding the net, especially in big games.The star player in an AC Milan team that dominated Italian and European soccer in the late 1980s and early '90s, Gullit won the Ballon d'Or in 1987.2. Andrés IniestaAndres Iniesta was a magician in midfield. / Orlando Ramirez-Imagn ImagesLionel Messi gets most of the plaudits for making FC Barcelona the best and most dominant soccer team on the planet in the 2000's and 2010s.Right behind the Argentine in terms of impact on the pitch, however, was Andrés Iniesta.The diminutive Spaniard was the driving force in Barca's midfield, able to turn defense into attack in the blink of an eye thanks to his genius playmaking instincts and unrivalled ball-carrying ability.He also came in clutch on the big occasion for Barca on multiple occasions, as well as for Spain, most notably scoring his country's only goal in 1-0 win over the Netherlands in the final of 2010 World Cup.1. Zinedine ZidaneZizou. / IMAGO/ABACAPRESS Nobody has ever, or likely will ever, do it like Zinedine Zidane. The Frenchman was dynamic yet languid, powerful yet graceful. He played soccer with a trademark Gallic nonchalance, but was somehow always one step ahead of the opposition.As former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes once put it, to see Zidane was "poetry in motion."A World Cup, European Championship, Champions League, and Ballon d'Or winner, "Zizou" is simply the greatest of all-time.READ MORE ON THE GREATEST IN SOCCERmanualPublished Dec 9, 2024|Modified Feb 7, 2025BARNABY LANEBarnaby Lane is a highly experienced sports writer who has written for The Times, FourFourTwo Magazine, TalkSPORT, and Business Insider.

We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (each, a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration, unless expressly provided otherwise in this Arbitration Section, and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Minute Media agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and that YOU AND MINUTE MEDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This Arbitration Section shall survive the termination of these Terms.2 . Exceptions and Opt-out Option. The only exceptions to this Arbitration Section are the following:you or Minute Media each may seek to resolve an individual Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.you or Minute Media each may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our respective intellectual property rights.you may opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute individually if you provide us with a signed, written notice of your decision to do so as provided below; however, if you are opting out of an updated version of this arbitration provision, you understand that you will remain subject to the prior version of any arbitration provision to which you had previously agreed.‍3 . Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification. You and Minute Media agree that, prior to initiating an arbitration or other legal proceeding, you and Minute Media will attempt to negotiate an informal resolution of the Dispute. To begin this process, and before initiating any arbitration or legal proceeding against Minute Media, you must send a Notice of Dispute ("Notice") by certified mail to the attention of Minute Media's Legal Department at the Minute Media address set out in these Terms. For purposes of these Terms, initiating an arbitration means filing an arbitration demand ("Demand").Your Notice to Minute Media must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name, address, username for the Website, and the email address associated with your account with the Service; (2) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; (3) a description of the relief you want, including any money damages you request; and (4) your signature verifying the accuracy of the Notice and, if you are represented by counsel, authorizing Minute Media to disclose information about you to your attorney.After receipt of your Notice, you and Minute Media shall engage in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days, which both sides may extend by written agreement ("Informal Dispute Resolution Period"). During the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, neither you nor Minute Media may initiate an arbitration or other legal proceeding related to the Dispute.If the Dispute is not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you may initiate an individual arbitration as provided below.4 . Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. Any arbitration must be initiated with and conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation ("NAM") pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (together, the "NAM Rules"), except as modified by these Terms. The NAM Rules are available at www.NAMADR.org, by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550. In any instance where the applicable NAM Rules and these Terms are inconsistent, these Terms shall control.An arbitration Demand filed with NAM must include a certification signed by the filing party verifying compliance with the Initial Dispute Resolution and Notification requirements and other requirements set out in this Arbitration Section.If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint the arbitration administrator.Any arbitration hearing will take place in New York, New York, unless you and Minute Media agree to a different location or to a virtual hearing.The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement, except that only a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York (and not an arbitrator) shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver set forth in these Terms or the Mass Filing procedures set forth in below are unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable.5 . Mass Filing Procedures. YOU AND MINUTE MEDIA AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF US IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A MASS ARBITRATION. Minute Media's receipt of one or more Notice(s) of substantially similar claims brought by or on behalf of 25 or more claimants (including you) within a 60-day period ("Mass Filing") shall be subject to the additional procedures set forth below. Claims included in a Mass Filing, if not resolved during the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, may proceed only in accordance with the procedures set out below, and subject to the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures ("NAM Mass Filing Rules", available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/") to the extent not contrary to these Terms. If a court determines that this requirement is not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim may only proceed individually in court consistent with these Terms.‍Batching: You and Minute Media agree that your and other individuals' claims deemed by Minute Media a Mass Filing may be filed with NAM in batches of no greater than 50 individuals' claims at one time, with 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by counsel for you and other claimants and 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by Minute Media. After your claim is batched and permitted to be filed as a Demand, you and Minute Media agree that selection and appointment of an arbitrator for your Demand shall be governed by the NAM Mass Filing Rules.First (Bellwether) Batch: The first batch of up to 50 Demands are the Bellwether Arbitrations. If your claim is included in the Bellwether Arbitrations, you and Minute Media shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference.Stay of Filing of Other Claims: If your claim is not among those selected for the Bellwether Arbitrations, your claim cannot be filed until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed in a later stage of this process. No arbitration fees will be assessed on you or Minute Media in connection with your claim unless and until it is assigned to a batch and authorized to be filed with NAM.Mediation: After the Bellwether Arbitrations are completed, if your claim remains unresolved, you and Minute Media agree to mediate your claim along with any other unresolved claims included in the Mass Filing (" Global Mediation"). The mediator will be selected according to the procedure set forth in the NAM Rules, and Minute Media will pay the mediator's fees. The Global Mediation shall be completed within 120 days of the selection of a mediator, unless extended by written agreement between you and Minute Media.Election To Proceed in Court: If Global Mediation is not successful in resolving your claim, and 100 or more claims included in the Mass Filing remain unresolved, you or Minute Media may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim resolved in New York, New York courts consistent with these Terms. You or Minute Media must exercise this election within 45 days of the completion of Global Mediation.Sequential Arbitration of Remaining Batches: If neither you nor Minute Media opt out of arbitration, another batch of no greater than 50 individuals' claims will be selected from the Mass Filing, with 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by counsel for claimants and 25 claims (or half of the total number of claims in a batch, if less than 50) selected by Minute Media. If your claim is included in this next batch of 50 claims, your claim will be filed with NAM, and you and Minute Media shall cooperate with the arbitrator assigned to your arbitration to resolve your claim within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference. The process of batching up to 50 individual claims at a time will continue until the parties resolve all claims included in the Mass Filing. No unbatched claim can proceed to be filed as a Demand until the previous batch has been resolved.Tolling. For any claim subject to these Mass Filing procedures, any statute of limitations applicable to your claim shall be tolled from the date the Informal Dispute Resolution Period begins until the earlier of (1) the date your arbitration Demand is filed, or (2) the date you or Minute Media opts out of arbitration as provided above.6 . Arbitration Costs. Payment of all arbitration filing fees and costs will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules. If you prevail on your claim in arbitration, Minute Media will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees you paid that exceeded the amount you would have paid to file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York. If Minute Media prevails on your claim in arbitration, and the arbitrator finds that your claim was frivolous or filed in bad faith, the arbitrator may award Minute Media reimbursement from you of Minute Media's arbitration filing fees and costs.7 . Offer of Settlement. Minute Media may, but is not obligated to, make a written offer to settle your claim at least 14 days before the arbitration hearing date. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If an award is issued in your favor but is less than Minute Media's settlement offer, the arbitrator may order you to pay the arbitration costs incurred by Minute Media after its offer was made, unless otherwise prohibited by the underlying law governing your claim.8 . Class Action Waiver.
